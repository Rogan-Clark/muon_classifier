* CORSIKA inputs file template for CTA prod-3 simulations of vertical muons into single telescopes.
* Starting altitudes, angles, and maximum impact parameters are site and telescope-type specific.
* The idea here is to simulate muons which _generally_ will result in complete rings within the
* field of view. For an unbiased simulation, higher starting altitudes, wider off-axis angles
* and wider ranges of impact parameters need to be covered, in most cases only resulting in
* partial rings.
*  - PRMPAR for primary particle type (default: 6)
*  - EMIN & EMAX for energy range (note: in TeV units! Default: 0.004 1.0)
*  - ESLOPE for spectral index (note: should be negative! Default: -2.0)
*  - ZENITH_ANGLE (in degrees; default: 0)
*  - AZIMUTH_ANGLE (in degrees; default: 180 = from [geomagnetic] North)
*    or as named alternatives: FROM_SOUTH, FROM_EAST, FROM_WEST
*  - DIFFUSE for telescope-type adapted VIEWCONE range
*  - VIEWCONE for manually selected VIEWCONE range
*  - CSCAT & NSCAT for core distance range and number of 'shower' uses
*    (note: CSCAT value in meters!)
*  - WRITE_CORSIKA_FILE -> write a file with photon bunches in the
*    CORSIKA working directory rather than piping it into a
*    matching telescope simulation.

*
* For evaluating multiple types of telescopes/cameras with multiple optical efficiency
* factors it may be better to write the photon bunches to disk and run the
* telescope simulations one after the other, instead of all in parallel pipes.
*
*
*
* IACT interface writes its output (through gzip or zstd or whatever) into a file
*
TELFIL cta-astrichec-muon-SST.corsika.gz      // If telescope simulation not done directly in pipe
*
* IACT interface writes its output through multipipe_corsika to immediate processing.
* Instead of different intermediate (symlinked) scripts we can now pass configuration
* options down to the one common script and can control the simulation variant from here.
